Hi, I'm Kumi! I'm a software developer, systems engineer, and the Chairperson of [Private.coffee](https://private.coffee), a privacy-focused association based in Austria. Here, you'll find a collection of my software projects.

Also check out the [Kumi Systems Profile](https://git.private.coffee/kumisystems) for more projects created in my professional capacity, and the [Private.coffee Profile](https://git.private.coffee/privatecoffee) for projects created by the association.

## 🌟 About Me

I'm passionate about privacy, security, and open-source software. I love building and operating tools that help people protect their data and stay safe online. I'm also a big fan of automation and scripting, and I enjoy creating tools that make (my) life easier.

## 🤝 Contributing

I am always open to contributions and new ideas. If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to fork any repository and submit a pull request. Let's create something amazing together!

## 📬 Contact

If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to say hi, you can reach me through through issues on here, or on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@kumi:private.coffee). I'm always happy to connect!

Thank you for visiting my profile! Happy coding! 😊
